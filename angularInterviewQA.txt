1. What are the events in angular
==========================

Dom Event
Directive event
Compontent event
Angular Lifecycle hook event
Forms event
Http event
Route event

==========================
2. angular lifecycle 
==============
ngOnInit
ngDocheck
ngOnChanges
ngDestroy
ngAfterViewInit
nagAfterViewChecked
ngAfterContentInit
ngAfterContentChecked 

==================================

3. What are the directives in angular ?
===========================
Structural Directive(ex : ngIf ngFor)

Component Directive (ex @Component)

Attribute Directive(ngClass, ngStyle)


============================================

4. What are the data binding in angular ?
============================
four types of data binding classified

Interpolation :
Property
Event
Twoway(@ngModel)

===================================
5. what is observable and promises in angular ?

promises
======
once subscribe canot be unsubscribe
it return single value
eager execution
immutable
.then() and .catch()

observable
==========
It can subscribe by using subscribe method and unsubscribe by usning unsubscribe method
It returns stream of values
It has lazy execution
It is mutable
It can cancel
It contain powerfull operators like map(), Filter()
==============================================================================
6. How to create Custome Directive

using below command can create 
ng g directive highlight

above command create two file 
highlight.directive.ts
highlight.directive.ts.spec(forunit tsesting)

highlight.directive.ts it contains @Directive decorator with selector as a appHighlight 
if you want create HostListener you can create
=================================================================
7. you can explain angular components ?

Template  (html)
Component (Typescript class)
Service (business logic  that is service to inject to component to reuseble the module)
Module(collection of component and service and pipes)
Metadata(maping information about component and template)
Databinding(establish connction between template and component)
Directive(manupulate Dom elaments)
Dipendency Injection(inject dependent module into target module)
Pipes(transfer the value before desplay)

============================================
8. How Exception handle in angular ?

To handle exceptions in http calls use rxjs operator like catchError
You can provide global error handler by extending angular ErrorHandler
Global error handler register in app.module.ts
You can also handle error directly within component
You can setup route for error pages(ex: Page Not Found)
Implement error interceptor for centralised http error management

=========================================================
9. What is Interceptor in angular and why ? types ?

interceptor is a class that implements to httpInterCeptor
Interceptor modify http request and response
HttpInterceptor sits between application and backend api


Interceptor topically used for

Adding Authorization header
Logging req and res
Handling error globally
Retry and failed request
Caching response

ng g service my-interceptor

register interceptor app.module.ts

=============================================
What are authguard and why use it ?


guards are interface that allow you control the navigation from routes
that means autherized user can view protected routes and un autherised can not routes

why ? 

authenticate/autherization => ensure logged user / autherised user can access specific routes

Data confirmation => user to save when unsaved changes when navigating away from form

role based access => user can access with specific roles to access particular page

lazy loading

cli command to create
ng g guard auth
auth.guard.ts

guards types:

canActivate  => route activation
canActivatedChild => activate Child routes
canDeactivate => prevent navigation from routes
canLoad  => control lazy laoding
canResolve  => resolve the data before route is activated

==============================================================

What is difference between Reactive forms and Template driven forms ?

Template driven forms:
------------------------------
form logic writen in template that is html
use angular directive like ngModule
suitable for simple forms

Reactive Forms:
----------------------
form logic writen in component class that is typescrpt
uses FormControl, FormGroup, FormBuilder
suitable for complex forms

====================================================
How optimise performance in angular  ?
==========================
use Lazy Loading to load module on Demand instead of startup
Implement OnPush Change detection 
Use  TrackBy with ngFor to improve rendering performance
use AOT compilation
Service worker

=============================================================
what is Tree Shaking, and how does angular use it ?

Tree shaking is process of removing unused code during build phase

ng build --prod

above command enable the AOT

============================================================
What is AOT (Ahead - of Time) compilation?

AOT compilation is angular compiler will load before broser loads application

enable command

ng build --aot

==================================================
What is TrackBy ?

to avoid unnecessary DOM upadates

===================================================

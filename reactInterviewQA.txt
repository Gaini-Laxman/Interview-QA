What is react and why it is so popular ?
=============================

react is a javascript library for building ui, developed by facebook
key features
=========
Component based artchetecture
Viertual DOM for faster rendering
One way Data Binding
React Hooks (introduce 16.8)

=============================================
What are functional and class component ?
Functional component :
A javascript function that accept props and return jsx

Class Component :
 A class Extending React.component with render() method

above functional component are prefered due to react hooks, 
which allows the state management in functional component

===========================================
What is "props" in Reactjs, and how do you pass them ?

props (properties) are used pass data from parent to child component
props are immutable and should not be change in child component

=================================================
How is state different from props in react ?

props are readonly data passes from parent to child

State is managed within a component and can be upadated using setState


==============================================================
What are the common lifecycle methods in class component ?

Mounting
     constructor()
     componentDidMount()

Upadating
      componentDidUpdate()
UnMounting
      componentWillUnmount()



============================================================================
What is hooks and and types of hooks ?

hooks are introduce 16.8
hooks in react are function that are manage React state and lifecycle feature from function component
class component manage state and lifecycle, by using hooks function component also manage state and side effect.

React hooks
=========
useState => allows you to add state to functional component
=======
Ex:  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

const is the state variable , setCount is function to update it.

useEffect
=======
used for the side effects like fetching data, subscriptions, or manual changing DOM

Ex:    useEffect(() => {
          document.tittle = 'Count: ${count}';
           }, [count]);

useContext
========
provide access to context value without need to use

<context.consumer>

ex : const theme = useContext(themeContext);


useRef
=======
create mutable reference that persist across the rendered often used to DOM element or store value without 
triggering re-render

const inputRef = useRef(null);

useReducer
========
alternative to useState for managing complex state logic

useMemo
=========
Memorise Computed value to avoid unnecessary calculations

useCallback
=========
Memorise function to avoid unnecessary re-creation on each render


useLayoutEffect
============

useImperativeHandle
================

useTransition

useDiferredValue


============================================================
Types of state React  ?

Local State
==========
Limited to single component
Manged using useState
Form input or toggle state in component

Global State
==========
Shared across multiple component
Managed using Context API, Redux, 
ex : Sharing user authentication state across multiple components.

Derived State
==========
State that is calculated from other state or props.
Typically avoided to prevent redundant state, but sometimes necessary

Ex: Calculating a total price from a list of items.

Session or URL State
================
Represents state based on URL parameters (e.g., query strings).
Managed using libraries like react-router.

Remote/Server State
==============
Data fetched from an external API (e.g., REST or GraphQL).
Managed with react-query, Redux, or custom hooks.

==========================================================
What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs)?
====================================
A Higher-Order Component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

================================================================================
What is the React Context API?
The Context API provides a way to share state across the component tree without prop drilling.

========================================================================

What is the useEffect hook, and how is it used?
useEffect is a side-effect management hook that runs after a component renders.

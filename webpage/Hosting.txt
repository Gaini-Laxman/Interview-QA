1. Get a Reseller Hosting or VPS/Dedicated Server

If you don't want to invest heavily initially, you can use Reseller Hosting. However, to fully own the setup:

Purchase a VPS or dedicated server from a reliable hosting provider like AWS, DigitalOcean, Linode, or Vultr.
Recommended Configuration:
8+ GB RAM (to support multiple users)
SSD storage
High bandwidth (unmetered if possible)
Static IP address

2. Register Your Domain and Set Up DNS
==================================
Purchase a domain name from a registrar like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains.
Use a DNS service (Cloudflare is a great free option) to set up your nameservers:
Example:
ns1.yourdomain.com -> Point to your server's IP
ns2.yourdomain.com -> Point to a backup IP (if available)

3. Install Web Hosting Control Panel

Install a hosting control panel to manage your clients and their websites easily. Popular options:

cPanel/WHM (Paid but industry-standard)

Virtualmin/Webmin
ISPConfig
These panels allow you to create hosting accounts, manage DNS, emails, databases, and file storage for your clients.

These tools help you:
Create hosting accounts automatically after payment.
